In 1979 the defendant and some of the elders of the town levied five cedis on every person living in the town to purchase a sheep to slaughter to pacify and purify their fetish Kobi in respect of alleged breaches of customary rules and taboos. The plaintiffs objected to the levy and rather paid Â¢300 for the purchase of implements for communal labour in the village. After the performance of the purification rites, the defendant published a list of customary rules and taboos to guide the conduct of the citizens of the town, breach of any of which attracted sanctions. One of the taboos proscribed the going to farm on certain days declared as sacred days. When the plaintiffs were found on their farms on one of those days they were arraigned before the defendant who then demanded that the plaintiffs should slaughter a sheep to pacify their fetish. When the plaintiffs refused to perform that rite, the defendant began to harass them and threatened to burn down their church. The plaintiffs thereupon brought action against the defendant for a declaration that they were entitled by law to worship and practice their Christian faith in freedom and an order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with the plaintiffs' enjoyment of their religious rights. In his defence the defendant contended, inter alia, that since customs formed part of the laws of the land, the plaintiffs could not opt out or be exempted from the observance of the rules published by the elders, and furthermore, the plaintiffs could only exercise their religious rights within the framework of the society in which they lived.</p><p>Held: chapter six of the Constitution, 1979 provided complete protection [p.294] of fundamental human rights, and article 27 expressly guaranteed protection of freedom of conscience. That protection was continued in force by the Provisional National Defence Council (Establishment) Proclamation (Supplementary and Consequential Provisions) Law, 1982 (P.N.D.C.L. 42). Accordingly, every person had every right to object to any act or rule the performance or observance of which might infringe his right of freedom of religion or belief. In the instant case, the defendant's belief that breaches of his prohibition against going to farm on Wednesdays, inter alia, would offend their gods or fetishes stemmed from their traditional religious beliefs; and that, however, was distinguishable from customary law as known and determined by the courts such as on customary marriage, divorce, land tenure, etc. Accordingly, the defendant was trying indirectly to impose his religious faith or beliefs on the plaintiffs. Since the defendant's threat to burn down the plaintiffs' church building, coupled with the plaintiffs' prosecution posed very serious peril to the plaintiffs' right of freedom of conscience and religion, the court would offer protection against the erosion of their individual liberties by granting them the reliefs they sought against the defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' claim would be granted.</p><p>NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS</p><p>ACTION by the plaintiffs, members of a Christian sect at Mpatasie against the defendant the chief of Mpatasie for a declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to practice their Christian religion in freedom, and also an order of injunction restraining the defendant and his elders from interfering with the plaintiffs' enjoyment of their religious rights. The facts are sufficiently set out in the judgment.</p><p>COUNSEL</p><p>John K. Kodua for the plaintiffs.</p><p>R. Twum Aninakwa for the defendant.</p><p>JUDGMENT OF LARTEY J.</p><p>The plaintiffs are the pastors and members of the True Faith Church at Mpatasie near Trede in the Ashanti Region and bring the action on their own behalf and on behalf of other members of the said church. The defendant was sued as the odikro or chief of Mpatasie and as representing the stool or oman.</p><p>About three years prior to the issuance of this writ in June 1982 the plaintiffs had been worshipping and pursuing their Christian faith in peace. That peace was disturbed when the defendant and his elders and the town development committee told the plaintiffs that they were going to slaughter a sheep for the defendant's fetish called Kobi and that every person living at Mpatasie should pay Â¢5 towards the performance of the fetish's rites. The plaintiffs objected to the payment of this levy but [p.295] offered to pay, and did pay Â¢300 for the purchase of implements for communal labour in the village.</p><p>The defendant and his elders later purported to make certain rules in relation to their fetish, which rules they sought to enforce against the plaintiffs. Some of those rules are as follows: that on certain days declared as sacred by their fetish nobody should go to the farm; that upon the death of a person in the town their fetish should be purified before anybody could go to his farm; that a woman in her monthly period should besmear her arms or hands with white clay; and that since their fetish Tano despised goats, nobody at the village should rear goats.</p><p>Pursuant to enforcing the rules, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs were on one Wednesday returning from their farms when they were arrested by agents of the defendant and arraigned before the defendant and his elders who required the said plaintiffs to slaughter a sheep to pacify the fetish Tano, which the plaintiffs refused to do. It was the case for the plaintiffs that the defendant and his elders have since then harassed them and have even threatened to burn down their church building. Upon these facts the plaintiffs have sued for a declaration that they are entitled by law to worship and practice their Christian faith in freedom. They also pray for an order of perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant, his elders or any other person or persons from interfering with the plaintiffs' enjoyment of their religious rights.</p><p>The defendant who claimed to be the representative of the stool and/or Mpatasieman of which the second, third and fourth plaintiffs form part averred as follows: that when it came to his notice that various customary rules and taboos had not been observed he met the elders and members of the town development committee and the people's defence committee to consider the lapses so that the observance and enforcement of the rules could resume. For that purpose he caused the citizens of Mpatasie to be customarily informed of the decision of the meeting by the beating of gong-gong. It was part of his case that in order to start on a sound footing it became customarily necessary that the whole town of Mpatasie should perform the customary rites of pacification and purification for previous breaches of the said rules and taboos. And since the exercise involved money, a levy of Â¢5 per citizen in accordance with the decision taken at the meeting was imposed, the payment of which money was voluntary.</p><p>The defendant denied that the plaintiffs objected to the decision of the oman but admitted that the plaintiffs appealed to him to be allowed to help the Mpatasie town in another sphere, which would not necessarily [p.296] be for the pacification rites. He again admitted receiving Â¢300 from the plaintiffs which money he described as the plaintiffs' contribution for the pacification and purification rites. The defendant further denied making new rules, claiming that the elders merely agreed to observe and enforce the existing rules. The defendant admitted the rules mentioned by the plaintiffs as some of those he and his elders sought to enforce.&nbsp;It was the defendantâs contention that since custom forms part of the laws of the land, the plaintiffs cannot opt out or be exempted from observing the rules as laid down by the elders of Mpatasie.</p><p>The Wednesday referred to by the plaintiffs was described by the defendant as Awukudae or Kuudapaakuo, a day on which by custom no person resident at Mpatasie should be seen to go to the farm, and therefore when the plaintiffs were seen returning from the farm carrying headloads of foodstuffs they were in breach of the said rules and taboos. Consequently, the plaintiffs were arrested by the servants of the Mpatasie stool and asked to pay an acknowledgment fee for the breach, but the plaintiffs failed to pay; whereupon the defendant slaughtered a sheep in accordance with custom. He averred that he has done nothing to prevent the plaintiffs and members of their church from exercising their religious freedom, and that they are still continuing with their worship in peace. The defendant finally contended that the plaintiffs' rights can be exercised within the framework of the society in which they live.</p><p>With the greatest respect to the defendant and his counsel, this last contention should totally and bluntly be rejected as misconceived if by that framework the defendant seeks to say that once he and his elders take a decision which even violates one's right, one has no cause to protest. This is the picture which emerges from the defence in this action.</p><p>Now it is needless to point out that under the Constitution, 1979, chapter 6 thereof provided complete protection for fundamental human rights. Under article 27 of the said Constitution, protection of freedom of conscience was explicitly guaranteed. And when the Provisional National Defence Council (Establishment) Proclamation (Supplementary and Consequential Provisions ) Law, 1982 (P.N.D.C.L. 42) came into force it did not seek to abrogate this fundamental liberty of the individual which included freedom of thought and of religion. Thus a person has every right to object to any act or rule if by performing that act or observing that rule his right of freedom of religion or belief is thereby infringed.</p><p>In the instant case, what the defendant and his elders seemed to have overlooked is that the set of rules referred to by the plaintiffs and admitted [p.297] by the defendant in the pleadings stems from religious beliefâthe belief that breaches of those rules, among others, would offend the gods or fetishes, in particular Tano and Kobi. I think it is important to distinguish between customary practices which are purely based on traditional religion or the belief in the supernatural (which is not capable of proof in our courts) and custom known and determined by the courts such as customary marriage, divorce, land tenure, etc. It does appear that in the matter before me, the defendant, his elders and the town development committee or the people's defence committees as they were then known, were trying indirectly to impose their religious beliefs on the plaintiffs who also shared a different religious faith or belief. The defendant and his elders ought to have known that their action was bound to be resisted by a section of the community. Having declared the payment per head of the Â¢5 to be on voluntary basis, it is difficult to understand the action of the defendant and his elders in dragging this matter to the point of causing the arrest and prosecution of the plaintiffs merely for their refusal to slaughter a sheep to purify and pacify the gods of the defendant.</p><p>There is evidence that the defendant and his elders or the oman have threatened to burn down the church building of the plaintiffs. In my view, these threats, coupled with the plaintiffs' prosecution, pose very serious peril to their right of freedom of conscience and of religion. I believe firmly in the courts offering protection against the erosion of individual liberties.</p><p>In the result, I grant the plaintiffs' claim as per the indorsement on their writ of summons. The two reliefs are hereby granted.</p><p>The plaintiffs will also have their costs fixed at Â¢120,000.</p><p>DECISION</p><p>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p><p>E.E.A.</p><p><br></p>"
